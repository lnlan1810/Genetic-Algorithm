# Genetic-Algorithm
This project addresses the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) for six or more cities using genetic algorithms. It incorporates distance data retrieved from the 2GIS API and visualizes the optimal path on a map. The primary goal is to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.
